# Project: 0x10-Variadic_functions

## Description
This project revolves around variadic functions in C programming. Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. The project includes a set of C files that demonstrate the usage of variadic functions to perform operations on different types of input.

## Task List

1. **0-sum_them_all.c**: This file contains a function that calculates the sum of a variable number of integers passed as arguments.

2. **1-print_numbers.c**: This file contains a function that prints a variable number of integers passed as arguments, followed by a newline.

3. **2-print_strings.c**: This file contains a function that prints a variable number of strings passed as arguments, followed by a newline. If a string is `NULL`, it will print `(nil)` instead.

4. **3-print_all.c**: This file contains a function that prints a variable number of arguments based on their corresponding data types: `char`, `int`, `float`, or `char *`.

## Usage
To use the functions defined in this project, follow these steps:

1. Compile the required source files using a C compiler.
   ```sh
   gcc -o program_name source_file.c
   ```

2. Run the compiled executable.
   ```sh
   ./program_name
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each program's behavior.
