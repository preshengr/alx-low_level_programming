# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains C programs that implement various string and array manipulation functions. Each task is implemented in a separate C file as described below:

## Task List

1. `0-strcat.c`: This function concatenates two strings.

2. `1-strncat.c`: This function concatenates two strings, but with a specified maximum number of characters to be appended from the second string.

3. `2-strncpy.c`: This function copies a string from source to destination, with a specified maximum number of characters to be copied.

4. `3-strcmp.c`: This function compares two strings and returns an integer indicating the relationship between the strings (greater than, equal to, or less than).

5. `4-rev_array.c`: This function reverses the content of an array of integers.

6. `5-string_toupper.c`: This function converts all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

7. `6-cap_string.c`: This function capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

8. `7-leet.c`: This function encodes a string using the "1337" (leet) substitution cipher.

9. `100-rot13.c`: This function encodes a string using the ROT13 cipher.

10. `101-print_number.c`: This function prints an integer.

11. `102-magic.c`: This program prints `a[2] = 98` followed by a new line. (Note: Specific implementation details are not provided in this task's description).

12. `103-infinite_add.c`: This function adds two numbers represented as strings.

13. `104-print_buffer.c`: This function prints the contents of a buffer.

## How to Use

Each task is implemented in its own C file and can be compiled separately. To compile and execute a specific task, you can use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -o task_name.c task_name
./task_name
```

Replace `task_name.c` and `task_name` with the appropriate file names for the task you want to compile and run.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your use case.
