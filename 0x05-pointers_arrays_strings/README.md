# C Programming Task: Pointers, Arrays, and Strings (0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)

Welcome to the C programming task focused on pointers, arrays, and strings! This task is designed to reinforce your understanding and proficiency in working with pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in the C programming language.

## Task Description

In this task, you will be provided with a set of exercises that involve pointers, arrays, and strings. Your goal is to implement C functions to perform specific tasks related to these concepts. Each exercise will have a specific function prototype and task description that you must follow.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your system. You can write the C code using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the directory for this task: `cd 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings`

## Task List

Below is the list of exercises you will find in this task:

0. **Task 0:** `Reset_to_98.c ;`
   - Description: Function takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value to 98 which is the value it points to.
   
1. **Task 1:** `Swap.c;`
   - Description: Function swaps the values of two integers

2. **Task 2:** `Strlen.c;`
   - Description: Function returns the length of a string.

3. **Task 3:** `Puts.c;`
   - Description: Function prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

4. **Task 4:** `Print_rev.c;`
   - Description: Function prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5. **Task 5:** `Rev_string.c;`
   - Description: Function reverses a string.

6. **Task 6:** `Puts2.c;`
   - Description: Function prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7. **Task 7:** `Puts_half.c;`
   - Description: Function prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

8. **Task 8:** `Print_array.c;`
   - Description: Function prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

9. **Task 9:** `Strcpy.c;`
   - Description: Function copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

10. **Task 100:** `Atoi.c;`
   - Description: Function convert a string to an integer.
  
11. **Task 101:** `Keygen.c;`
   - Description: a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
## Guidelines

1. Your task is to implement the functions corresponding to each exercise. These functions should be placed in a separate C file (e.g., `pointers_arrays_strings.c`) within the same directory.

2. Create a header file (e.g., `pointers_arrays_strings.h`) where you declare the function prototypes for each exercise.

3. In your C file, include the header file with the function prototypes you have declared.

4. Implement the functions for each exercise following the provided function prototypes and descriptions.

5. After implementing the functions, compile your code using your C compiler: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o main`

6. If there are no errors during compilation, run the executable: `./main`

7. Check the output to ensure your functions are working correctly.

## Submission

Once you have completed the task, you can submit your code through your preferred method (e.g., pushing your changes to a remote repository if using Git).

Good luck and happy coding! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
