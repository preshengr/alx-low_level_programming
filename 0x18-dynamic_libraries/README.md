## Introduction
Welcome to the 0x18-dynamic_libraries repository! This repository contains files related to dynamic libraries in C programming. The README provides an overview of the files and instructions on installation, usage, and contributing.

## Files
### 1-create_dynamic_lib.sh
Description: Shell script for creating a dynamic library from all the `.c` files in the current directory.

### 100-operations.so
Description: Dynamic library containing various mathematical operations.

### 101-make_me_win.sh
Description: Shell script with a special purpose related to dynamic libraries.

### libdynamic.so
Description: Dynamic library generated by the `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` script.

### main.h
Description: Header file containing function prototypes and declarations for use in the project.

### putshack.c
Description: C file with a function demonstrating a basic example of dynamic library usage.

### putshack.so
Description: Dynamic library containing the implementation of the function in `putshack.c`.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and use the dynamic libraries:

1. Run the `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` script to generate the dynamic library:
   ```bash
   ./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh
   ```

2. Use the generated dynamic library in your programs:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -L. -ldynamic -o your_program your_program.c
   ```

   Replace `your_program` with the name of your C program.

## Usage
To use the dynamic libraries in your C programs:

1. Include the `main.h` header file in your source code:
   ```c
   #include "main.h"
   ```

2. Compile your program with the dynamic library:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -L. -ldynamic -o your_program your_program.c
   ```

3. Run your program:
   ```bash
   ./your_program
   ```
