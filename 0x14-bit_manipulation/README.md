6. [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c): Clear a Bit.
7. [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c): Count Flipped Bits to Convert One Number to Another.
8. [100-get_endianness.c](./100-get_endianness.c): Check Endianness of System.
9. [101-password](./101-password): More Bitwise Password Manipulation.

Each project file addresses a specific concept or task related to bit manipulation in C programming. Please refer to each individual project for detailed explanations, implementation details, and usage examples.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the C programs, you can use a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
./<output_file>
```

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and adapt it for your own purposes.
