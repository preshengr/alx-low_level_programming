## Description

The "0x14-bit_manipulation" project is a compilation of C programs that demonstrate various bit manipulation techniques. Each project file addresses specific tasks related to manipulating individual bits within data.

## List of Projects

The following projects are included in this repository:

1. [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c) - Convert binary strings to unsigned integers.
2. [01-password](./01-password) - Implement a password system using bit manipulation.
3. [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c) - Print the binary representation of a number.
4. [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c) - Get the value of a bit at a specific index.
5. [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c) - Set a bit at a specific index to 1.
6. [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c) - Clear a bit at a specific index.
7. [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c) - Count the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.
8. [100-get_endianness.c](./100-get_endianness.c) - Determine the endianness of the system.
9. [101-password](./101-password) - Implement an advanced password system using bit manipulation.
10. [main.h](./main.h) - Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.

## Usage

Each project contains a C file with specific functions related to the task. You can compile and run these programs individually to see the results.

To compile a project, you can use a command like:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -o project_output project_file.c
```

Replace `project_output` with your desired output executable name and `project_file.c` with the name of the project's C file.
