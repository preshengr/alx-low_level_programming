# 0x0B-Malloc_Free

Welcome to the **0x0B-Malloc_Free** project! This repository delves into the concept of memory allocation in C programming using the `malloc` and `free` functions. Memory allocation is crucial for dynamically allocating memory space during program execution, and the `malloc` function is commonly used for this purpose.

## Task List

1. `0-Create_array.c`: This source file contains a function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.

2. `1-Strdup.c`: This source file contains a function that duplicates a string using dynamic memory allocation.

3. `2-Str_concat.c`: This source file contains a function that concatenates two strings.

4. `3-Alloc_grid.c`: This source file contains a function that creates a 2D array of integers.

5. `4-Free_grid.c`: This source file contains a function that frees a 2D array of integers previously created by the `alloc_grid` function.

6. `100-argstostr.c`: This source file contains a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program into a single string.

7. `101-strtow.c`: This source file contains a function that splits a string into words.

8. `main.h`: This header file contains function prototypes and any necessary macros for the functions implemented in this project.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and utilize the functions implemented to understand memory allocation and deallocation. To compile a specific source file, you can use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic source_file.c -o output_name
```

Replace `source_file.c` with the name of the source file you want to compile and `output_name` with the desired name of the compiled executable.

Remember to include the appropriate header file using `#include "main.h"` in your program to access the function prototypes.

Enjoy your exploration of memory allocation and deallocation in C!
