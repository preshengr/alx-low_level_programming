# 0x0A-Argc_Argv

Welcome to the **0x0A-Argc_Argv** project! This repository focuses on understanding and utilizing the concepts of `argc` and `argv` in C programming. `argc` stands for "argument count," and it represents the number of command line arguments passed to a program. `argv` stands for "argument vector," and it is an array of strings containing the command line arguments.

## Task List

1. `0-whatsmyname.c`: This source file contains a program that prints its own name.

2. `1-args.c`: This source file contains a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.

3. `2-args.c`: This source file contains a program that prints all the arguments it receives.

4. `3-mul.c`: This source file contains a program that multiplies two numbers.

5. `4-add.c`: This source file contains a program that adds positive numbers.

6. `a.out`: This is the compiled output file of one or more of the source files.

7. `main.h`: This header file contains function prototypes and any necessary macros for the functions implemented in this project.

8. `100-change.c`: This source file contains a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and compile the source files as needed. To compile a specific source file, you can use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic source_file.c -o output_name
```

Replace `source_file.c` with the name of the source file you want to compile and `output_name` with the desired name of the compiled executable.

Remember to include the appropriate header file using `#include "main.h"` in your program to access the function prototypes.

Enjoy your exploration of `argc` and `argv`!
