# THE DIRECTORY
- The contents of this directory are the scripts written in liu of the projects of ALX trainings.
> This project's main focus is on C functions and the nested functions adding more light on the loops to help understand why and how they can be used.
## BELOW ARE THE LIST OF PROJECTS AND THIER DESCRIPTIONS
