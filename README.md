# alx-low_level_programming

Welcome to the `alx-low_level_programming` repository! This repository contains code and projects related to low-level programming tasks and exercises. 

## About

This repository is maintained by [Precious O Amaechi], and it serves as a learning and practice resource for low-level programming concepts in the C programming language. It contains a series of projects, each focusing on specific aspects of low-level programming, such as pointers, arrays, strings, and basic algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a different project or topic. Here is an overview of the repository structure:

- `0x00/`: This directory contains the source code and files for the first project.
- `0x01/`: This directory contains the source code and files for the second project.
- ...
- `0x014/`: This directory contains the source code and files for the 14th project and still counting.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to a specific project directory: `cd alx-low_level_programming/projectX` (replace `X` with the project number you want to explore).

## Running the Code

Inside each project directory, you'll find the necessary C source files and headers to compile and run the code. You can use a C compiler such as GCC to build the programs.

For example:

```bash
cd alx-low_level_programming/project1
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o project1
./project1
```
