# 0x0C-more_malloc_free

Welcome to the **0x0C-more_malloc_free** project! This repository continues the exploration of dynamic memory allocation in C programming using `malloc`, `free`, and related functions. Dynamic memory allocation is essential for managing memory resources efficiently and flexibly.

## Task List

1. `main.h`: This header file contains function prototypes and any necessary macros for the functions implemented in this project.

2. `0-malloc_checked.c`: This source file contains a function that allocates memory using `malloc` and checks if the allocation was successful.

3. `1-string_nconcat.c`: This source file contains a function that concatenates two strings up to a specified number of bytes.

4. `2-calloc.c`: This source file contains a function that allocates memory for an array using `calloc`.

5. `3-array_range.c`: This source file contains a function that creates an array of integers with values ranging from `min` to `max`.

6. `100-realloc.c`: This source file contains a function that reallocates a memory block using `realloc`.

7. `101-mul.c`: This source file contains a program that multiplies two positive numbers.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and utilize the functions implemented to understand and apply dynamic memory allocation. To compile a specific source file, you can use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic source_file.c -o output_name
```

Replace `source_file.c` with the name of the source file you want to compile and `output_name` with the desired name of the compiled executable.

Remember to include the appropriate header file using `#include "main.h"` in your program to access the function prototypes.

Enjoy your continued exploration of dynamic memory allocation in C!
