# 0x08-recursion

This repository contains C programs that implement various recursive functions. Each task is implemented in a separate C file as described below:

## Definition of Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached, and then combining the results to get the final solution.

## Tasks

1. `0-puts_recursion.c`: This function prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.

2. `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: This function prints a string in reverse order using recursion.

3. `2-strlen_recursion.c`: This function returns the length of a string using recursion.

4. `3-factorial.c`: This function returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

5. `4-pow_recursion.c`: This function returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

6. `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: This function returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

7. `6-is_prime_number.c`: This function returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns 0 using recursion.

8. `100-is_palindrome.c`: This function returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if it is not using recursion.

9. `101-wildcmp.c`: This function compares two strings and returns 1 if they can be considered identical (wildcard characters '*' are allowed), otherwise returns 0 using recursion.

## How to Use

Each task is implemented in its own C file and can be compiled separately. To compile and execute a specific task, you can use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -o task_name.c task_name
./task_name
```

Replace `task_name.c` and `task_name` with the appropriate file names for the task you want to compile and run.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your use case.
