# 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains C programs that implement various pointer and string manipulation functions. Each task is implemented in a separate C file as described below:

## Tasks

1. `0-memset.c`: This function fills a block of memory with a specified constant byte.

2. `1-memcpy.c`: This function copies a block of memory from a source address to a destination address.

3. `2-strchr.c`: This function searches for the first occurrence of a specific character in a string and returns a pointer to that character.

4. `3-strspn.c`: This function calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists of only the characters found in another substring.

5. `4-strpbrk.c`: This function searches a string for any of a set of bytes and returns a pointer to the first matching character.

6. `5-strstr.c`: This function finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string and returns a pointer to the beginning of the substring.

7. `7-print_chessboard.c`: This function prints a chessboard represented as a 2-dimensional array of characters.

8. `8-print_diagsums.c`: This function prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

9. `100-set_string.c`: This function sets the value of a pointer to a char.

10. `101-crackme_password`: This file contains the password for the crackme2 executable. (Note: Specific implementation details are not provided in this task's description).

## How to Use

Each task is implemented in its own C file and can be compiled separately. To compile and execute a specific task, you can use a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -o task_name.c task_name
./task_name
```

Replace `task_name.c` and `task_name` with the appropriate file names for the task you want to compile and run.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your use case.
