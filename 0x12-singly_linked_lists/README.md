## Project: 0x12-singly_linked_lists

Welcome to the project "0x12-singly_linked_lists"! In this C programming task, you will be working with singly linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Linked lists consist of nodes, each holding a value and a pointer to the next node. Your goal is to implement various functions that operate on these linked lists.

### Tasks Overview

1. **0-main.c**: This file contains a simple main function to test the functions you'll be implementing.
2. **0-print_list.c**: Implement a function that prints all the elements of a linked list.
3. **1-list_len.c**: Create a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.
4. **100-first.c**: Write a function that prints a message before the main function is executed.
5. **101-hello_holberton.asm**: This assembly file contains a program that prints "Hello, Holberton" using inline assembly.
6. **2-add_node.c**: Implement a function to add a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
7. **3-add_node_end.c**: Create a function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
8. **4-free_list.c**: Write a function to free all the nodes of a linked list.
9. **lists.h**: This header file contains function prototypes and structures used across the project.

### Getting Started

To begin working on this project, navigate through the tasks' source code files and implement the required functions. Use the provided header file "lists.h" to ensure your functions are correctly prototyped.

### Compilation and Testing

You can compile and test your functions using the provided main function in "0-main.c". Make sure to include the necessary files during compilation.

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o linked_list
```

Run the executable and observe the output to ensure your functions are working as expected.

### Additional Notes

This project will help you gain a deeper understanding of linked lists, memory allocation, and function implementation in C. Be sure to read the task descriptions carefully and follow good coding practices while writing your code.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn as you work through the tasks. Best of luck, and enjoy the journey of mastering linked lists in C programming!
